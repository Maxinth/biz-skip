# Skip Selection Page

This is a **Skip Selection Page** built with **React (TypeScript), Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion, and Chakra UI**. It allows users to browse available skip sizes, select one, I've set it up so that a user can select a skip size and the drawer will open to show the details of the selected skip.

I've developed only the skip selection view and interactions therein as requested in the outline for the assessment.

## Features

- **Dynamic Skip Selection**: Users can choose from different skip sizes (selecting a skip size brings the drawer into view) - they can also unselect a size if they wish. Unselecting a size will close the drawer.
- **Interactive Drawer**: A bottom drawer displays details about the selected skip, hover interactions and selection interactions.
- **Smooth Animations**: Powered by Framer Motion.
- **API Integration**: Fetches skip data from an external API.
- **Responsive Design**: Fully mobile-friendly.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React (TypeScript), Tailwind CSS, Chakra UI
- **State Management**: React hooks
- **Animations**: Framer Motion
- **API Handling**: Fetch API
